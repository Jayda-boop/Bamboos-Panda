  <img src="images/painting02.jpg"/><title>Stitch</title> Stitch is a character that goes through phases and challenges that make him at times feel misunderstood or out of place. Stitch reminds me of myself sometimes and he happens to be my favorite color blue.

      <img src="images/painting03.jpg"/><title>Portrait</title> This a panting of my face and arms when I was about 6 months and the angel wings and halo were transfered over from a picture of an angel tattoo on Google. I painted myself as angel to highlight my innocences and tell a story.

     <td>
      <img src="images/painting04.jpg"/><tite>Corona Quarentine</title> I made this table of do's and do not's as a project to promote safety at the beginning of the pandemic. I did not exactly use paint on this canvas, instead I used oil Pastels and only some paint for line definitions.
